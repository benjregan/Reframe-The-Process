          <h2>MALLORY</h2>

          <p>Mallory absolutely NEEDS to get her morning coffee in before class. She refuses to drink out of a keurig, must be small batch organic nonsense even though she doesn't know what any of it actually means. She's always late to class, with coffee in hand. She'll be attending JWU in the fall and must scout out local coffee shops before arriving.</p>

          <h2>HER BACKGROUND</h2>
          <p>Mallory recieves a $500/week allowance from the bank of dad. She just graduated from Fontbonne Academy, and she is majoring in Travel &amp; Tourism at JWU. She has all the latest tech but has no clue how any of it works. She uses both her iPhoneX and 2017 MacBook Pro to browse the internet, but she spends the vast majority of her time on Instagram and Snapchat.

          <h2>CARL</h2>

          <p>Carl went to Providence College to get a business degree, and got a job in sales downtown right after graduation. He doesn't know the downtown area too well, and usually sticks to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks out of convenience/laziness. He heard about Small Point from a co-worker who said they have great coffee and wants to try it out.</p>

          <h2>HIS BACKGROUND</h2>
          <p>Carl has a new sales job right in the heart of downtown Providence. He makes $45k a year plus some commissions. Carl is pretty good with technology, he uses his Samsung Galaxy S8 on the go or his desktop computer at work. He also has a Google Pixelbook for easier browsing at home.</p>

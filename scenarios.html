          <h2>MALLORY</h2>

          <p>In her spare time Mallory has been researching coffee shops around downtown Providence. She does this at home on her laptop as well as on the go on her iPhoneX. She's looking for a shop that's open early as she's signed up for 9:20s her first tri. She likes to see variety in the menu as she often explores different roasts and blends. She also enjoys breakfast foods with her morning coffee but is very picky about ingredients. She would like to see something with an organic or non-GMO label to reassure her that the food is healthy.</p>

          <h2>CARL</h2>
          <p>A recent Providence College graduate, Carl, has a new job doing sales in downtown Providence. He drinks coffee nearly every morning but generally sticks to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks out of convenience because they're everywhere in this city. He heard about Small Point Cafe from a co-worker who said they have great coffee and great service. Carl is considering trying it out but wants to check it out online first.

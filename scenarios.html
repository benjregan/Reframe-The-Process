            <h2>Jimmy</h2>

            <p>Jimmy signed up to work his school's yearbook because he likes getting involved (and he wants to make sure he gets in it a lot). Because of his love of instagram he's always been interested in photography, and lately he has been saving up to buy a DSLR so he can get more into it. He needs to learn to quickly because he wants his photos to appear in the yearbook. He found the site through his friends recommendation and is hoping to research a little bit about what cameras to buy as well as how to operate them. He knows a little bit about composition and the basics of taking photos but is still a beginner and wants to improve.</p>

            <h2>Karen</h2>
            <p>Karen wants to invest in a better camera, because she thinks that it will instantly make her photos come out better. She found the site because one of her friends shared an article from it on facebook. She was impressed by the images the site had to offer and wanted to find what camera the photographers on the site use so her photos can look as good as theirs.</p>
